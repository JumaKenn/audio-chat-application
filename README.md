# audio-chat-application
An app with which users can stay connected through out with earbuds, listen to the same music and an algorithm that filters good conversations.
Due to latency issues, I think the first prototype should include only recorded conversations which should be at least be of the same day.
Ask users for permission to share the recorded clip.
Create groups where users trust each other and no permission is needed to share voice notes within that group.
Voice notes that receive many likes get played to more users. maybe many taps on earbuds to like.
